/**
 * MCP server — lets Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor or any other MCP
 * client work directly against this install's data.
 *
 * Transport is stdio, so the client spawns this process locally and
 * there is no port, no network surface and no second authentication
 * story: it runs as whoever owns the database file, and that is exactly
 * the person allowed to read it. An HTTP transport would need its own
 * auth, and getting that wrong on a process that can edit live websites
 * is not a trade worth making for convenience.
 *
 * Configure it in an MCP client with:
 *
 *   {
 *     "mcpServers": {
 *       "seo-tool": {
 *         "command": "npx",
 *         "args": ["tsx", "scripts/mcp-server.ts"],
 *         "cwd": "/path/to/this/repo",
 *         "env": { "SEO_DB_PATH": "/path/to/data.db" }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * NOTHING may be written to stdout except protocol messages. A stray
 * console.log corrupts the JSON-RPC stream and the client sees a parse
 * error rather than a useful failure, so all diagnostics go to stderr.
