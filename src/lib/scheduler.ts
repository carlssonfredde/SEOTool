/**
 * In-process scheduler for the background runners.
 *
 * Before this, all six runners hung off a single line in the dashboard
 * page component:
 *
 *     try { tickDailyAgent().catch(() => {}); } catch {}
 *
 * which meant nothing ran unless a human loaded `/`. Go on holiday and
 * rank checks, page monitoring, alerting, scheduled reports and the
 * weekly digest all silently stopped — while the queue UI kept telling
 * users "publishes on the next daily-agent tick (≤24h)". For a product
 * sold to agencies on automation, the automation was a side effect of
 * someone opening a browser tab.
 *
 * This is a long-lived Node server (`next start` / the Docker CMD), so
 * a plain interval is the right tool — no external cron, no extra
 * service, still works on the $5 VPS the project targets. The dashboard
 * still nudges the scheduler on load, which covers the case where the
 * process was asleep or just restarted.
 *
 * Two properties the old approach lacked:
 *
 *   1. **Crash-safe claiming.** tickDailyAgent wrote its `last_run`
 *      BEFORE doing the work, so a process that died mid-run skipped
 *      the entire batch for 24h with no record. Runners here record
 *      started/finished separately, so an interrupted run is visible
 *      and retried rather than silently swallowed.
 *   2. **Per-runner isolation.** One runner throwing can't stop the
 *      others, and each records its own last-success timestamp.
